## Marine isotope stages

aliases of Marine isotope stages:

- MIS
- marine oxygen-isotope stages
- oxygen isotope stages (OIS)

### What is MIS ?

MIS are alternating warm and cold periods in the earth history. They study the oxygen isotope data from deep sea core samples to know the changes in temperature long ago.

### What can we know from MIS?

Stages with  even numbers have  lower O^18^ levels and represent cold glacial periods.

Stages with odd numbers have higher O^18^ levels and represent warm interglacial periods.

## Holocene(全新世)

Holocene is the current geological epoch, beginning about 11,650 Cal years before present. Holocene and preceding Pleistocene form the Quaternary period together.
